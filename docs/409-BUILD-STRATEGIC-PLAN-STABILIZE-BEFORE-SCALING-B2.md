# Strategic Plan: Stabilize Before Scaling (B2 Phase)

## Overview
Systematic stabilization approach focusing on reliability, monitoring, and production readiness before scaling operations. This plan addresses the foundational infrastructure needed for robust SmartSuite API operations.

## Strategic Timeline

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure (Sept 15-19, 2025)

#### Day 1-2: Auth Context Implementation âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: PRODUCTION READY (95/100)

**Completed Work**:
- âœ… Implemented `src/audit/audit-context.ts` with AsyncLocalStorage
- âœ… Complete test coverage in `src/audit/audit-context.test.ts`
- âœ… Integration with `src/audit/audit-logger.ts`
- âœ… TypeScript compilation clean
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Code review: Production ready (95/100)

**Key Achievements**:
- Auth context propagation using Node.js AsyncLocalStorage
- Context isolation between concurrent requests
- MCP tool handler integration
- Graceful fallback for missing context
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

**Files Modified**:
- `src/audit/audit-context.ts` (NEW)
- `src/audit/audit-context.test.ts` (NEW)
- `src/audit/audit-logger.ts` (MODIFIED)

#### Day 3-4: Input Validation Layer ðŸ”„ NEXT
**Target**: Comprehensive input validation for all MCP operations

**Planned Work**:
- Schema validation for SmartSuite field formats
- Request payload validation
- Error handling standardization
- Validation middleware implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- All MCP tools validate inputs before processing
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Prevention of silent data loss scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage

#### Day 5: Schema Conditionals Fix ðŸ“‹ PENDING
**Target**: Resolve SmartSuite schema conditional field handling

**Planned Work**:
- Fix conditional field visibility logic
- Improve field discovery reliability
- Enhanced schema parsing
- Better error diagnostics

## Week 2: Monitoring and Observability (Sept 22-26, 2025)

### Day 1-2: Enhanced Audit Logging
- Transaction correlation
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking enhancement

### Day 3-4: Health Monitoring
- System health endpoints
- Resource monitoring
- Alert thresholds

### Day 5: Integration Testing
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance benchmarking
- Load testing framework

## Week 3: Production Hardening (Sept 29 - Oct 3, 2025)

### Day 1-2: Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker implementation

### Day 3-4: Security Hardening
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Access control refinement

### Day 5: Documentation and Runbooks
- Operational procedures
- Troubleshooting guides
- Performance tuning guides

## Success Metrics

### Reliability Targets
- 99.9% uptime for core operations
- < 500ms response time for read operations
- < 2s response time for write operations
- Zero silent data loss incidents

### Quality Gates
- All tests passing
- TypeScript compilation clean
- ESLint compliance
- 90%+ test coverage for critical paths

### Operational Readiness
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Health monitoring dashboard
- Automated error recovery
- Clear escalation procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **SmartSuite API Changes**: Maintain version compatibility layer
2. **Performance Degradation**: Implement performance monitoring
3. **Data Integrity**: Enhanced validation and audit trails

### Operational Risks
1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation
2. **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Early identification and planning
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits

## Key Learning: Role Boundary Violations

**Discovery**: During implementation, identified that BUILD.oct command was causing orchestrators to perform implementation work instead of coordinating specialists.

**Resolution**: Updated BUILD.oct.md with ROLE_AWARE_ROUTING to ensure:
- Holistic-orchestrator coordinates but doesn't implement
- Specialists handle their domain expertise
- Clear separation of orchestration vs execution
- Alignment with WORKFLOW-NORTH-STAR RACI patterns

**Impact**: Improved role clarity and prevented capability boundary violations that could lead to suboptimal outcomes.

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- SmartSuite API stability
- Node.js AsyncLocalStorage support
- MCP protocol compatibility

### Internal Dependencies
- Test infrastructure completion
- Schema validation framework
- Error handling standardization

## Next Phase Preparation

### B3 Phase Prerequisites
- All B2 stability goals achieved
- Performance baselines established
- Monitoring infrastructure operational
- Security hardening complete

### Scaling Readiness Indicators
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Performance metrics within targets
- Operational procedures validated
- Team knowledge transfer complete
