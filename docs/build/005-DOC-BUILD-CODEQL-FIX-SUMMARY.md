# CodeQL Issues Resolution Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. CodeQL Action v2 Deprecation
**Status:** FIXED ✅
- Upgraded from `github/codeql-action/*@v2` to `@v3`
- Updated both `init` and `analyze` actions

### 2. CLI Version Warning
**Status:** FIXED ✅
- Added `tools: latest` configuration to avoid fallback warnings
- Specified `javascript-typescript` as the language for better detection

### 3. Permissions Configuration
**Status:** FIXED ✅
- Added required permissions for CodeQL v3:
  - `id-token: write` for OIDC authentication
  - `pull-requests: read` for PR context
  - `security-events: write` for SARIF upload

### 4. Analysis Configuration
**Status:** ENHANCED ✅
- Added `upload: true` for explicit SARIF upload
- Added `wait-for-processing: true` for synchronous processing
- Added `queries: security-and-quality` for comprehensive scanning

## Remaining Manual Configuration Required ⚠️

### Enable Code Security in GitHub Repository
**Error:** "Code Security must be enabled for this repository to use code scanning"

**Solution:** Repository admin must:
1. Go to https://github.com/elevanaltd/smartsuite-api-shim/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable **Code scanning**
3. Select "Set up → Advanced" (since we have custom workflow)
4. Save changes

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated CodeQL actions and permissions
2. `REPOSITORY_SETUP.md` - Created comprehensive setup guide

## Commits Made

1. `28a6919` - fix: upgrade CodeQL actions from v2 to v3 with proper permissions
2. `fb3f68f` - docs: add repository setup guide for Code Security and branch protection

## Verification

After enabling Code Security in GitHub:
```bash
# Re-run the failed workflow
gh run rerun 17463061553

# Or trigger a new run
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: verify CodeQL v3 setup"
git push
```

## Expected Outcome

Once Code Security is enabled:
- ✅ CodeQL analysis will complete successfully
- ✅ SARIF results will upload to Security tab
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities will be tracked
- ✅ Branch protection can be configured with security checks
