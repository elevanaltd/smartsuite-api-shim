# SmartSuite API Shim - B2.02 Universal Test Engineer

## Current Progress
- [x] Analyzed existing test coverage (31.38%)
- [x] Identified missing test scenarios (47+ tests needed)
- [x] Improved SmartSuite client type interfaces
- [x] Created comprehensive TDD specification document
- [ ] Implement Phase 1: Extend existing test files with CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement Phase 2: Create new focused test files (pending security approval)
- [ ] Implement Phase 3: Integration and edge case tests
- [ ] Verify all tests fail (RED state validation)
- [ ] Measure coverage improvement (target: 80%+)

## Next Immediate Action
Create failing CRUD operation tests in existing test/smartsuite-client.test.ts file

## Test Coverage Gaps
- SmartSuite client CRUD operations: 11 tests needed
- Error handling scenarios: 8 tests needed  
- MCP server tool operations: 15 tests needed
- Integration tests: 6 tests needed
- Configuration/edge cases: 7 tests needed

Total: 30+ new failing tests to be implemented (TDD RED state)
