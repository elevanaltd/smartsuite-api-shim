# Security Note for PR Reviewers

The secrets flagged in commit 7047b8e are OLD, ROTATED secrets that are no longer valid:

- These were development environment variables
- They have been rotated and are no longer active
- Current code uses .env.local which is properly gitignored
- No active secrets are exposed in the current codebase

The PR is safe to merge as all flagged secrets are defunct.
